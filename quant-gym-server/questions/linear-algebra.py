Easy

Array Sum: Write a function that takes a NumPy array and returns the sum of all its elements.

Element-wise Multiplication: Given two arrays of the same shape, return a new array containing their element-wise product.

Transpose a Matrix: Write a function that takes a 2D NumPy array and returns its transpose.

Medium

Matrix-Vector Multiplication: Given a 2D NumPy array A and 1D array v, compute the product A @ v.

Row-wise Mean: Implement a function that computes the mean of each row in a 2D NumPy array.

Diagonal Extraction: Write a function that returns the main diagonal elements of a square NumPy matrix.

Hard

Matrix Determinant: Compute the determinant of a square NumPy array without using any explicit loops.

Solve Linear System: Given a square matrix A and vector b, solve for x in Ax = b using NumPy.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Write a function that computes all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given square matrix.

Matrix Rank and Null Space: Given a matrix, write a function that returns its rank and a basis for the null space using NumPy.

PCA Implementation: Given a 2D NumPy array representing data samples, write a function that performs principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data to k dimensions. Your function should center the data, compute the covariance matrix, extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and return the transformed dataset along the top k components.
